                                Formulary evaluation is a tedious process, sometimes taking six months to just reach a decision on which drugs to remove from or add to the pharmacy. Healthcare leaders have to consider cost-savings, efficacy, and variation of which pharmaceuticals are preferred by the doctors at their various hospitals.
