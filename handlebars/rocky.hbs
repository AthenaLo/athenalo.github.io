	When students master skills within the eSpark experience, 
	they receive a high five to celebrate their effort and achievement. 
	To answer the need for the face of delight in eSpark, 
	I created a character and that has become the eSpark mascot.

	    Previously, at the end of each quest was a door to the next set 
	    of activities. The door gave the same outcome at the end of quests 
	    regardless of exerted effort or achievement result.

            <p>
              This became deflating for students, who felt as if the doors never ended.

	      I set goals for what would be an appropriate role for the eSpark avatar 
	      should play. Through research of existing critter companions/guides, 
	      and testing our iterations along the way, we refined the avatar into an 
	      initial introductory and celebratory role.

		The eSpark avatarâ€™s first job is to help students celebrate their success. 
		At the end of quests, each student receives a personal high five in 
		congratulations for achievement. Students who did not master the skill 
		are still thanked for their efforts with a hearty hand shake.

		In his first full school year, the eSpark avatar has given 625,000 high

		I also advocated that, since this avatar was designed for the students, 
		they should get to name him, partnering with our marketing team to arrange 
		a contest that was held on Twitter. Tweets pertaining to the avatar spurred 
		the most activity from followers and after over 200 votes, a 2nd grade 
		classroom in California won the contest with the name Rocky. 
		We flew out there to hand deliver special prizes, as well as ask these 
		students to participate in co-creating the next version!

		The effect of Rocky has been significant amongst eSpark partners,
